# Space-Invaders

<b> A simple clone of the popular arcade game Space Invaders using JavaScript and Kaboom.js </b> 

<p> In this game, users pilot a spaceship to attack enemy aliens in space. The object of the game is to shoot as many of the aliens 
as you can before the time runs out. The user can see the countdown and current score in the top right of the screen. The game ends
when the timer reaches zero or if the enemy aliens reach the spaceship. The gameover screen displays the user's final score. </p>

<b> The goal of this game was to understand the basics of Kaboom.js and improve my JavaScript skills by recreating a classic arcade game. </b>

Core Concepts I learned Completing this Project:
----------------------------------------------
-	Implementing Kaboom.js to create simple games using the JavaScript Library
-	Using Kaboom.js to create different scenes and add layers
-	Creating different sprites directly in the Replit project and calling them in functions 
-	Creating action and collision functions so that sprites objects can interact with each other
-	Learning how to debug JavaScript games

Possible Improvements:
----------------------------------------------
-	Add win screen 
-	Add new levels
-	Include a difficulty selection of easy, medium, or hard
-	Allow enemy aliens to shoot back and maneuver randomly around the screen
